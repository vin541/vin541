Which of the following statements about sets are true? Select all that apply.

 you understand the properties of a set! A set is a mutable data structure - you can modify the elements in a set with methods like add and pop. A set is an unordered data structure, so you can't index and slice elements like a list; there is no sequence of positions to index with!

One of the key properties of a set is that it only contains unique elements. So even if you create a new set with a list of elements that contains duplicates, Python will remove the duplicates when creating the set automatically.
